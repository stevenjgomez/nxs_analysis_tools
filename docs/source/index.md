# nxs-analysis-tools

## Overview

nxs-analysis-tools is a toolkit for managing and analyzing single crystal scattering datasets that have already been processed and stored in the NeXus file format (.nxs). Some notable functionalities are facile plotting of arbitrary reciprocal space planes with the correct angle between axes, data symmetrization, an all-in-one class for difference pair distribution function analysis (delta-PDF), data rotations, linecuts, rebinning, and even interactive / animated plots for an easier exploration of reciprocal space. For data output from data reduction tools like [NXRefine](https://github.com/nexpy/nxrefine), this package also provided a means to analyze an entire temperature series of scattering data at once, allowing for easier analysis of temperature-dependent features in the data.
